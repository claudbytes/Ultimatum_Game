instructions,na,Welcome to the study: Brand Perception in the Ultimatum Game,"<b>Please note</b>: this experiment does not allow you to go backward therefore it is crucial that you read all the instructions carefully before pressing the button to continue. <br><b><i>Introduction</b></i><br>I am an undergraduate fourth year Honours psychology student at the University of Glasgow carrying out my dissertation research. You are being invited to take part in a study about individuals perception of brands. It is important for you to understand why the research is being conducted and what it will involve. Please take time to read the following information carefully.<b><i><br><br>Purpose of the study</b></i></br>The aim of this experiment is to investigate the behavioural correlates of brands perception. To our knowledge, no other study in the past has compared the interaction between brands or people in an economic setting, nor has used the paradigm of the ultimatum game to investigate it. Therefore, the aim of the current experiment is to bridge such conceptual gap by testing whether human beings tend to interact with brands in the same way they would interact with an object or a human being.

instructions,na,Brand Perception in the Ultimatum Game,"<i><b>Participation</i></b><br>Your participation in this project is entirely voluntary. You are not obliged to take part and should you agree to participate, you can withdraw from the study at any time during the project. If you do not wish to participate you do not have to provide any explanation and you will not be contacted again. Moreover, if you agree to take part, your name and any of your personal details will not be recorded and the information collected will not be disclosed to third parties.

instructions,na,What is a Trust Game ,"In a Trust Game there are two players: an investor and a trustee. When the game starts, a sum of money is allocated to the investor who can decide whether or not to invest their money. If the investor decides to invest their money, the amount of money is multiplied by 4 and the trustee receives 4 times the initial amount of money. Once the trustee has received the money, they need to make the final decision: <br>1. to reciprocate half the money <br>2. to keep it all for themselves.<b><br>Example</b>: the investor is given 10£. If they decide to trust the other person, they will invest their money and the 10£ will be multiplied by 4 so the trustee will receive 40£. At this stage, the trustee can either decide to keep everything (40£) and the investor gets nothing, or he can decide to split it equally and they would both get £20.

instructions,na,The Current Experiment,"In this part of the study, you will be required to play the “Ultimatum Game”. <b><i><br><br>What is the Ultimatum Game?</b></i><br>The Ultimatum Game is  a classic economic-bargaining paradigm which involves two players (the responder and the proposer)  who have to split a certain amount of money between themselves. Specifically, the Proposer is attributed a certain amount of money and must decide the amount to give to the other agent, the Responder. Aware of the total offer and the amount suggested by the Proposer, the Responder will decide to either accept or reject the offer. Accepting the offer leads to a split of the sum accordingly to the Proposer suggestion. On the other hand, rejecting it will leave both the agents with nothing. <br>For the current study, you will always play the role of the Responder, while a brand, a person or a computer-generated algorithm will alternate in the role of the Proposer. Before performing the actual experiment, you will have time to practice with a mock trial in order to ensure you have fully understood the instructions.
